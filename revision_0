{Austin Longo}

Plan: Initial
As a single person group, I will not require work delegation. However, I will set forth to create a scenario that will encompass all three pages of the website. Then, I will sketch out the three pages with the scenario in mind. I will then get them prototyped in HTML using Bootstrap and revise from there.

Scenario: Initial
Bartley (pictured left) is a lonely robot seeking companionship. He gets the idea to browse a dating site to meet other like-circuited robots. He stumbles upon bot-Harmony.com and is greated with a friendly account creation page asking for his details. After creating an account, Bartley is brought to his personal account page. When he finishes admiring how good the site has portrayed him, he sets out on his quest for a mate by accessing the search page and viewing potential interests.

Scenario: Revised
After Bartley has perused bot-Harmony, he wishes to chat with Tori, another Amazon Boxbot on bot-Harmony. He enters his profile page and sends her a chat in the chatbox at the bottom right of the screen.

Team 14
Clifford Min, Make up Hackathon

Plan: Initial
Create the initial sketches and general UI design. Since this is a dating site, the design component is important to create a sense of relatability.
Take into account the different but crucial components that is needed for a dating site to be successful e.g. a sign up screen, a profile page etc.
Implement them in code using bootstrap and html, functionality doesn’t need to be implemented, so at least the design needs to be representational. 

Plan: Revised
Due to the new requirements, we now need to implement a photo sharing behavior/screen. This doesn’t change fundamentally the vision of product. It will be an additional feature.
Design a sketch of the photo sharing screen.
Implement it in code and connect it to our central web app.

Scenario: Initial
Frustrated with a supposedly perfectly calculated pairing, Earl, our robot, is notfinding that it is indeed “perfect.” He takes it upon himself to enable his free willA.I. to find a suitable partner, even though it may take more effort. He understandsfeelings are a nebulous and imperfect concept, so he’s willing to take the risk, a68.9% chance of failure he says. However he doesn’t have an resource to help him do so. A friend suggests a website called, robotdatingmadeeasy.com and so he connects and browses.  

Scenario: Revised
After searching and appreciating the site for how it allows a short shot at copulating with a female robot, he wants to share his experiences to increase his chances by providing a riveting backstory to his “life” for said act. However he doesn’t have a way to share his photos. So now an additional user story needs to be made to enable him to do so.
